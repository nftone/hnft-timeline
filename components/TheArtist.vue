    <h1>The artist</h1>
    <p>
      Get to know Lugosis, the artist behind Outlawz. Some people refer to him
      as
      <i>Enfant perdu</i>
      and the tattoo on his face is a clear message of why they call him so. No
      wonder, Lugosis started drawing before he could even speak. Everywhere and
      whenever there was time, he worked on his creations without even looking
      up.

      Using the walls of his family home in Italy as a canvas, these walls
      quickly transformed into the facades of big cities. Getting lost in his
      drawings and then on the streets, like a stray dog at night, the now
      Berlin-based artist has left his nest and travels the world without a
      destination. For the wanderer inside Lugosis, however, the city of Milan
      played an important role in the development of who he is today. The
      streets, walls, trains and people connecting to the Italian metropolis has
      led the all-rounder to be one of the most desirable underground artists
      Europe has to offer.

      The cartoon characters he draws may seem childish and playful, but you
      might want to take a closer look. The way Lugosis transforms his thoughts
      and perception of the world into illustrations will take your breath away.
      Inspired by different characters, weirdos and misfits, the artist
      recognizes the beauty in the non-conventional. He expresses his own
      reality, through a variety of creative approaches. From graffiti to
      tattoos, he tries to understand the world around him without prejudice.

      Lugosis has collaborated with different types of Streetwear brands, from
      "garage screen printers" to the "big players" such as Nike, Montana Cans,
      <u>Carhartt</u>
      ,
      <u>MaÂ®ket</u>
      ,
      <u>Dr. Martens</u>
      and
      <u>Tod&#x27;s</u>
      . Every project he has been involved in has been celebrated by many. It
      was only a matter of time before Lugosis took his work to another level to
      create something of his own.
